# Homework Assignment 3 - Financial Analysis and Election Analysis Python Scripts

## Description

These scripts (`PyBank/main.py` and `PyPoll/main.py`) use the `csv` module to read in data from CSV-formatted files, then perform analysis on them. The analysis is then printed to the console, and to a file (which is unique for each script)

The `PyBank` script collects the following data:

* Total number of months in the dataset
* Net total amount of profit and losses in the dataset
* Each change in profit/loss between each month, and the average across all of them
* Greatest increase in earnings
* Greatest decrease in earnings

The `PyPoll` script collects the following data:

* Total number of votes
* Complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate won
* Percentage of the total votes each candidate won
* Winner of the election

## Notes

Both scripts are intended to be run from within their respective folder, not from within the root folder.

Comments are provided at the function level, but my code was designed to be self-commenting, so the only mid-function comments are things that would not have been obvious from variable names and code behavior.
